This is a readme.  Thank you for reading me.  You should really compile my project in NetBeans and run it.  I promise you, you will enjoy it.

Also, you should know that my project needs its game file.  If you should have trouble locating it, it likes to hang out in the src/cpsc215project1/ directory.
